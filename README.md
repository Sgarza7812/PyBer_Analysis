# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview
•	The purpose of the PyBer Analysis was to show how the different city types affect how much the company makes. We looked at how much each city type made in Fares, how many drivers each city type has, and how many rides were given in each city type.

###Results

•	 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78935982/114338380-91a59380-9b18-11eb-96fc-6f6d7d40ae6a.png)

•	The image above shows that that the number of rides each city type has relates to the Average Fare price.
o	The more rides that each type gives, the less the average fare is. Looking at the Rural City type, they have the least number of rides but the highest Average Fare Price, while the Urban City type has the greatest number of rides but the lowest Average Fare Price.

•	From the image above, you can see that Urban City type has the greatest percentage of Total Drivers and that could be why they have the lowest Average Fare Price.

•	You can see that the more drivers the City Type has the more rides they are able to give and the Total Fares is greater. However, when looking at the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, you can see that the Rural City Type has less drivers but higher averages while Urban City Type has more drivers but lower averages.

####Summary

•	In summary, the more drivers the city type has the more rides we can give and the more we can gain in fares but the average per ride and average per driver make will decrease. We need to look at population count of the different city types to see if we need to move drivers around to be able to give more rides in the Rural and Suburban City types and increase Total Fares. We also need to look at what the competition is doing, do they have more drivers or are more people using their apps. By looking at the competition, we can see how we can grow our footprint in the three different city types.
